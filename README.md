# Lucca Forrest - Academic Portfolio

This repository hosts the academic portfolio and personal website of **Lucca Forrest**, a Computational Physics & Mathematics Researcher.

## Overview

The website showcases my academic background, research affiliations, and technical projects, featuring:
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Fluid dynamics background, neural network simulations, and thermodynamic visualizations.
- **Project Portfolio**: Detailed breakdowns of projects in computational physics, including:
    - Neuromorphic Evolution Spiking Networks
    - Energetics of Negentropy Learning
    - K-Means Cluster PCA Decomposition
    - 3D Heat Diffusion
    - Multivariate Newton-Raphson Basins
    - Lorentzian Spectrum Fitting
    - Coupled Spring Normal Modes

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with animations, responsive design, and a dark-themed aesthetic.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Canvas animations (fluid dynamics), scroll reveals, and interactive elements.
- **Assets**: Custom GIFs and project documentation.

## Deployment

This website is designed to be hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

### Automatic Deployment
This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/static.yml`) that automatically deploys the website to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

To enable this:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Pages** in your GitHub repository.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
3. The workflow will pick up the next push (or you can manually trigger it from the **Actions** tab).

Alternatively, you can deploy from a branch:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
2. Select **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Choose `main` as the branch and `/ (root)` as the folder.
