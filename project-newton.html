            <h1>Multivariate Newton-Raphson Basins</h1>

            <p class="bio">
                Physical system: trajectories in the \((x,y)\) plane as a two-variable nonlinear system relaxes toward
                its roots. Starting seeds are scattered around the domain so each basin funnels a different path down to
                a shared surface.
            </p>

            <p class="bio">
                Math: Newton updates \(x_{k+1} = x_k - J^{-1}(x_k)F(x_k)\) for
                \(F = [2x^3 - 6xy^2 - 1,\; 6x^2y - 2y^3 + 3]\).
                Inverting the Jacobian yields step directions; I halve the step for smoother motion and log
                \( \lVert F \rVert_2 \) to build a convergence landscape. Cubic interpolation fills in trajectories for
                the animation.
            </p>
            <p class="bio">
                Why convergence wiggles: near-singular Jacobians flatten directions so steps overshoot; seeds that start
                across basin boundaries bounce between attractors; and damping the step slows otherwise quadratic
                convergence into a more linear crawl until the iterates get close to a root.
            </p>

            <p class="bio">
                Why it matters: basin structure tells you how sensitive a solver is to initialization; shallow valleys
                and singular Jacobians flag where line searches or trust regions are needed before deploying Newton in
                higher dimensions.
