            <h1>K-Means Cluster PCA Decomposition</h1>

            <p class="bio">
                I used this approach during work with nVerses Capital; I can’t share the proprietary setup,
                but the public workflow is below.
            </p>

            <p class="bio">
                Motivation: standard K-Means gives quick centroids, but a single cluster can dominate.
                Instead of inflating \(k\) globally, I split only the oversized cluster along the directions
                that matter most (identified via PCA).
            </p>

            <p class="bio">
                K-Means solves
                \( \arg\min_{\{\mu_j\}} \sum_i \lVert x_i - \mu_{c(i)} \rVert_2^2 \)
                by alternating assignment
                \( c(i) = \arg\min_j \lVert x_i - \mu_j \rVert_2 \)
                and centroid updates
                \( \mu_j = \frac{1}{|C_j|}\sum_{i \in C_j} x_i \).
                PCA identifies orthogonal directions of maximum variance. The eigenvectors of the centered
                covariance matrix
                \( \Sigma = \frac{1}{n-1} X^\top X \)
                define components \(u_1, u_2, \dots\), ordered by explained variance.
            </p>

            <p class="bio">
                Procedure in the current generator: for each 3D Gaussian dataset (150 points),
                run K-Means with \(k=4\) and isolate the largest cluster.
                Fit PCA on this subset and use \(u_1\) as the long axis. The split occurs at the midpoint of
                the projection range along \(u_1\). The separating plane is orthogonal to \(u_1\) and spanned
                by \(u_2\) and \(u_3\). The primary axis is drawn solid, the orthogonal axis dashed, and the
                plane sits between the resulting halves.
            </p>

            <p class="bio">
                Color and motion: the oversized cluster uses <code>x</code> markers and gradually transitions
                into two target colors (white and a deeper accent) that pulse out of phase. Other clusters
                retain their base colors. I’ve visualized the decomposition as clearly as possible despite
                the difficulty of showing a split in 3D.
            </p>

            <p class="bio">
                Because the procedure depends only on projections and distances, it generalizes to any
                dimensionality and can be adapted to split multiple clusters, choose different PCA components
                or custom directions, and apply variance- or density-based conditional splitting rules.
